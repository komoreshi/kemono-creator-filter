# Kemono Creator Filter

This is a fork of the original userscript `Kemono.Party - User Filter` provided on [Sleazy Fork](https://sleazyfork.org/en/scripts/471723-kemono-party-user-filter). Credits to [天音](https://sleazyfork.org/en/users/164321-%E5%A4%A9%E9%9F%B3)

Due to Kemono switching to React, the original userscript no longer works. This version (as hacky as it is) should work with React router.

Blocked creators are stored in the userscript's value storage under the `blacklists` key. Violentmonkey and Tampermonkey allow you to view and edit this should you wish to import anything.
